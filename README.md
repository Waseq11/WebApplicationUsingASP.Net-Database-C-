Hello,
This is Web Application developed by me using ASP.Net Web Forms, C# and DataBase (Microsoft Access) on Visual Studio 2019.
It is a demo website for the Teachers for Saint Michel Technology Institution.
There is login validation. The Login is '4444' and the Password is 'Henry4444'.
After you login,you can choose a teacher and the courses the teacher is assigned is shown. All this is done through ASP.Net framework and Database
The Database is in the ./finalProject_1913864/App_Data. I used the Microsoft Access to create the database and assign the information accordingly.
You can add a course to the selected teacher using the appropriate buttons on the right side of the window.
